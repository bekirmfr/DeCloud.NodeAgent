# DeCloud Relay VM NAT Configuration Callback
# Version: 3.0 - Sequential orchestrator notification
#
# This script runs on relay VM boot to notify the node agent
# of the VM's IP address so NAT rules can be configured.
#
# Flow:
# 1. Configure NAT rules on host (node agent)
# 2. On success → notify orchestrator that relay is fully ready
# 3. Orchestrator sets IsActive=true only when relay can serve traffic
#
# Key improvements:
# - Sequential callbacks (NAT first, then orchestrator)
# - Idempotent (checks marker file)
# - Validates node agent is ready before calling
# - Better error handling and logging
#
